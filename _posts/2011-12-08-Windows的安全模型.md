To understand how it works, one needs a basic understanding of the Windows security model. With this model all processes have an *access token*. This access token is like an ID card, it contains information about the owner of the process, the list
 of groups that it belongs to and a list of privileges. Each process has its own token, and the system uses it to deny or grant access to resources. 
These resources are called *securable objects*. They are securable because they are associated with an access control list, or *security descriptor*. It contains the security settings of the object. The list of all the users and groups having
 access to the resource, and what kind of access they have (read, write, execute, etc) can be found there. Files, registry keys, mutexes, pipes, events, semaphores are examples of securable objects.
The *access check* is the mechanism by which the system determines whether the security descriptor of an object grants the rights requested to an access token. It is performed every time a process tries to acquire a securable object.

In Windows, code cannot perform any form of I/O (be it disk, keyboard, or screen) without making a system call. In most system calls, Windows performs some sort of security check.
